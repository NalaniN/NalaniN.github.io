		<p>Buster is a retired racing greyhound who came to live with Benjamin and Nalani in San Francisco in the spring of 2013. His track name was Atascocita Vance, he raced mostly in Florida. He was born in April 2009, he'll be celebrating his 7th birthday this year (2016). </p>
		<p>He loves to run, but he really loves to run with the pack, which made him just an 'okay' racer because he was always waiting for his pals. In his free time Buster likes to sleep, eat, do zoomies (greyhound-human speak for running around in circles VERY quickly), play with his white fuzzy squeaky toys, check in on his baby sister Rosie, sleep, eat, and sleep. Most people think that greyhounds are full of energy. Buster will tell you that he has short bursts of energy, but mostly he likes to snooze around the house. </p>

		<p>Around 8 weeks greyhound pups are weaned from their mothers. Usually they remain with their litter mates on a greyhound farm where they chase, run, and play. At 5 months they are paired off, and spend the next 7 months in serious training which includes leash training, learning voice commands, and getting to know a muzzle. At 1 year old greyhounds are moved to a training facility near a race track. Here they have a disciplined schedule and learn to exercise and run against other hounds. At 14 months greyhounds begin training on the track twice a week. Between 15 and 18 months greyhounds move to the track and train there as well. There they have their first race, a non-betting preliminary. If they do well in the preliminary, they move on to their maiden race. At this point if the greyhound has not raced well, they are retired. </p>
		<p>On the track, greyhounds usually race twice a week. The rest of the time they spend in their 3ft x 5ft kennel. It's estimated that greyhounds on the track are kenneled 21/24 hours a day. Often dogs are muzzled while kenneled.</p>

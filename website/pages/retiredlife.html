		<img src="../images/sleepybuster.jpg" height=500 class="textwrap">
		<p>Thanks to organizations like Golden State Greyhound Adoption, greyhounds are able to transition to a life off the track once they're deemed unfit to race. </p>
		<p>For Buster, he came off the track in Florida, and made his way to Colorado where he stayed at veterinarian Dr. Heather Weir's facilities. Dr. Weir then transports or "hauls" dozens of hounds to California from her Colorado facilty. Once in California the hounds come to Stuart and Barbara Homer's house, and from there the hounds are fostered out to different families. Buster went to stay with Mark and Julie, until he was placed in his forever home with Benjamin and Nalani. </p>
		<p>Greyhounds are referred to as the "fastest couch potatoes", or "40mph couch potatoes." Much of their time on the track is spent kenneled, some estimate up to 21 hours a day (in a 3ft x 5ft crate). Retired life includes a lot of lying around as well, but instead of kennels filled with shredded paper, retired racers get to enjoy dog beds and quiet homes. </p>
		<p>In retirement Buster has learned crazy things that we had just assumed all dogs know. For example, he learned that sometimes people drop food on the ground, and that once it's on the ground he can gobble it up. He has slowly become accustomed to loud vehicles like the bus and the garbage truck. When we first got him, at the sound of a bus he'd turn around and head for home shaking like a leaf. He still hates fireworks, and we can't quite figure out how to acclimate him to random loud bangs without giving him a heart attack. He definitely recognizes greyhounds as "different" from other dogs, and is thrilled when we bump into other neighborhood greyhounds when we're out on walks. It's been a wonderful journey so far, and we get to know him a little more every day. We're excited to see what the future holds for him, and what more we'll learn about him in retirement.</p>

		<p>HISTORY</p>
		<p>Sighthounds have been bred for millennia as hunting dogs. Until the early twentieth century greyhounds were primarily bred and trained for hunting and coursing (chasing). Now greyhounds are primarily bred for racing or lure coursing.</p>
		<p>ANATOMY</p>
		<p>A greyhound's anatomy is the reason for its speed, they can reach a full speed 43mph within 6 strides! There are very few mammals that can accelerate faster over short distances, only the cheetah and the pronghorn. Greyhounds are light, but muscular, with the highest percentage of fast-twitch muscle of any dog breed. They have a very flexible spine, and they run with a double suspension gallop. The double suspension gallop describes the running gate of a greyhound, all four of a greyhound's feet are off of the ground when a greyhound is contracted and when it is extended.</p>
		<p>MANNERS and TEMPERAMENT</p>
		<p>Off the track, greyhounds are known for their easy-going manner. They are generally quiet, gentle, and loving. Greyhounds can be sensitive animals, gentle commands usually work best. Greyhounds make excellent apartment or "small space" dogs, as they are used to being in very small spaces on the track, and usually sleep at least 18 hours a day.</p>
